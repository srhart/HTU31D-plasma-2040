# HTU31D-plasma-2040
Use the HTU31D with a Plasma 204


Very basic and dirty Python code. Maybe usefull to some, uses direct I2C from the Pimoroni Plama 2040 (https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/plasma-2040) to the Adafruit HTU31D (https://www.adafruit.com/product/4832)

The code also uses a 60 LED strip to show the temperature.

Nuff said.
